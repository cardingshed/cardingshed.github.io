An ex card-player, I can be found working at [Andrew Robson Bridge](www.andrewrobson.co.uk), and teaching for the [Open University](https://www5.open.ac.uk/stem/mathematics-and-statistics/).

I'm a statistician interested in uncertainty - `R` is the first-class language that I prefer, occasionally a little `Python`.

I enjoy playing with natural languages too, run trails and study yoga. I ðŸ’š learning, so always happy to hear *your* interests!
