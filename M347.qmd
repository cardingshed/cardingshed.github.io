## You will enjoy M347 if...

::: incremental
-   you're interested in **why** stats works mathematically
-   you love the idea of taking a deep dive into Bayes
-   you're curious about when your data science models are valid (and when they aren't!)
-   you aren't afraid of a little algebra üòÅ

## Coursebooks

Four coursebooks, four extra exercise books and a handbook! (click to enlarge)

## Interactive web-based content

M347 units were written to be browser-friendly (bonus to hard-copy and pdf versions)...

Screencasts (short lectures) pre-recorded for many key topics.

The standard bivariate normal distribution:

$$f(z,w) = \frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{1-\rho^2}}\exp \left[-\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{z^2-2\rho zw + w^2}{1-\rho^2}\right)\right]$$

. . .

So if the correlation $\rho = 0$, this simplifies to: $$f(z,w) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \exp \left[-\frac{1}{2} \left({z^2 + w^2}\right)\right] $$

. . .

$$f(z,w) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp \left[-\frac{1}{2}z^2\right]\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp \left[-\frac{1}{2}w^2\right] = f(z)f(w)$$

. . .

What famous result does this help us understand?

## Day-in-the-life of M347

For musicians - scales; For mathematicians - exercises!

## Thanks for visiting!

I enjoyed M347 as an OU student, and hope you find it as intriguing and rewarding as I did!
